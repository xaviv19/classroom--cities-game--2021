## Entering the game

### All it's in the browser

You are reading this blogpost, so you already
know where the game is. Yes, in your browser.

### Create a player

But before start, you need to create a player:

 * You should be at the welcome screen.
 * Go to the signup.

 > You should be at the signup screen.  
 > Add your name as player name.  
 > Set your password.  
 > Click the signup button.  
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->

At this point,

 > You should be back at the welcome screen.  
 > You should see a message saying that "The leonard player has been added successfully".  

## Checking data

We are all human, (are we?), and we can
fail, so we have few failsafe to avoid
errors.

### No player name

It is necessary the player name.

 > Go to the signup.  
 > Click the signup button.  
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=400 -->
 > You should be at the signup screen.                                       
 > You should see an error message saying that "Player name should be present".       

### Too short player name

And it should have at least three characters long

 > Add "jo" as player name.              
 > Click the signup button.            
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=400 -->
 > You should be at the signup screen.                                         
 > You should see an error message saying that "Player name should be at least three characters long".  

### No password

It should have a password.

 > Add your name as player name.     
 > Click the signup button.         
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=400 -->
 > You should be at the signup screen.                                         
 > You should see an error message saying that "Password should be present".  

### Too weak passwords

It should have at least 6 characters.

 > Set "short" as password.  
 > Click the signup button.  
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=400 -->
 > You should be at the signup screen.                                         
 > You should see an error message saying that "Player password should be at least six characters long".  

And at least one number.

 > Set "nonumbers" as password.  
 > Click the signup button.  
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=400 -->
 > You should be at the signup screen.  
 > You should see an error message saying that "Player password should have at least one number".  

And some letters

 > Set "123456" as password.  
 > Click the signup button.  
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=400 -->
 > You should be at the signup screen.                                          
 > You should see an error message saying that "Player password should have at least one letter".
