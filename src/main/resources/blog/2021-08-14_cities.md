# Cities

Finally, there is some game logic here.
Yes, this is a game about cities.

You can see your city, and the cities of your 
friends in the game. 

## Playing game

### We need to create a game and join

Start playing with penny. 

 * Given that "penny" is playing.
 * Go to the next player "leonard"
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->
 * You should be at the "game" screen.  
 * "leonard" should be the current player.

And you can see your cities:

 * "leonard" should have 1 "city".
 * "leonard" should have the "Capital" "city".

And you can see the penny cities.

 * "penny" should have 1 "city".
 * "penny" should have the "Capital" "city".
  
### City details

You can see your city details.

 * Go to the "leonard" "city" "Capital".
 * You should be at the "entity" screen.
 * You should be at the screen of a "city".
 * The _name_ content should be "Capital".
 * The _type_ content should be "city".
 * The _owner_ content should be "leonard".

And players can change the name of cities.

 * Enter new name "Leoland".
 * Click the change name button.
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->
 * You should be at the screen of a "city".
 * The _name_ content should be "Leoland".

### Others cities

You can see others cities.

 * Go back to the previous screen.
 * You should be at the "game" screen.
 * Go to the "penny" "city" "Capital".
 * You should be at the "entity" screen.
 * You should be at the screen of a "city".
 * The _name_ content should be "Capital".
 * The _type_ content should be "city".
 * The _owner_ content should be "penny".

But you cannot change the others cities name.

 * There should be no _change name_.

### Others see the changes

Others players can see its own cities, and others players.
And if the name changes, they will see it.

 * Go to the next player "leonard"
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->
 * You should be at the "game" screen.
 * "leonard" should be the current player.
 * "penny" should have 1 "city".
 * "penny" should have the "Capital" "city".
 * "leonard" should have 1 "city".
 * "leonard" should have the "Leoland" "city".
