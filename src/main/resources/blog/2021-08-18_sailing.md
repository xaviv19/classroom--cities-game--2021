# Sailing

Everything is at some place, and you can go from
one city to another city sailing with ships.

From city to city, through the sea.

## Sailing and locations

### Cities locations

Cities are created at locations, 0, 5, 10, ... as players join.
One separated by 5 to the next one.

 * Given that "leonard" is playing.
 * And that "penny" is playing.
 * Go to the next player "sheldon"
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->
 * Go to the "leonard" "city" "Capital".
 * The _location_ number should be 0.
 * Go back to the previous screen.
 * Go to the "penny" "city" "Capital".
 * The _location_ number should be 5.
 * Go back to the previous screen.
 * Go to the "sheldon" "city" "Capital".
 * The _location_ number should be 10.
 
And of course, their ship locations are the same than the cities.

 * Go to see the docked "sheldon" "ship" "Beagle".
 * The _location_ number should be 10.
 
### Sailing

Sailing takes time, you cannot go from one 
place through several rounds. 

 * The _destination sail_ state should be _inactive_.
 * Enter number 5 as _destination location_.
 * Set sail.
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->  

The ship does not move immediately:

 * The _location_ number should be 10.
 * The _destination sail_ state should be _active_.
 * The _destination location_ number should be 5.

But round after round:

 * End the round.
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->
 * Go to the "sheldon" "ship" "Beagle".
 * The _location_ number should be 9.
 * The _destination sail_ state should be _active_.
 * The _destination location_ number should be 5.

Until it arrives.

 * Skip 4 rounds.
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->  
 * The _location_ number should be 5.
 * The _destination sail_ state should be _inactive_.

And you can see that it docked at penny city:

 * It should be docked at the "penny" "city" "Capital".

### Halting the voyage

It is possible to cancel the voyage or halt the ship, before start:

 * The _destination sail_ state should be _inactive_.
 * Enter number 0 as _destination location_.
 * Set sail.
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->  
 * The _destination sail_ state should be _active_.
 * The _destination location_ number should be 0.
 * Halt sailing.
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->  
 * The _destination sail_ state should be _inactive_.

But it is also possible to halt the ship during the trip in the middle 
of nowhere.

 * The _destination sail_ state should be _inactive_.
 * Enter number 10 as _destination location_.
 * Set sail.
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->  
 * End the round.
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->  
 * Go to the "sheldon" "ship" "Beagle".
 * The _destination sail_ state should be _active_.
 * The _destination location_ number should be 10.
 * The _location_ number should be 6.
 * It should not be docked.
 * Halt sailing.
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->  
 * The _destination sail_ state should be _inactive_.
